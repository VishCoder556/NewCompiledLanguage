# CompiledLanguage
A simple compiled language, with special libraries that make creating programming languages easier.

## Libraries
- [Dynamic Arrays](./libraries/dymarray) - A simple library that makes dynamic arrays easier
- [Linked Lists](./libraries/dymarray) - A library that eases the use of linked lists inside of structures
- [Error Library](./libraries/error) - An error-handling library (WARNING: Barely Developed)
- [Tokenizer Library](./libraries/tokenizer) - A way to create a simple tokenizer without a bunch of code 
- [Parser Library](./libraries/parser) - A bunch of macro hacks including parsers and ASTs that let you decide a language's grammar (like GNU BISON, but it's in C)
- [TypeInfo Library](./libraries/typeinfo) - A typechecker library that checks the types of ASTs
- [IR Library](./libraries/ir) - A customizable intermediate representation based on TAC
- [Register Allocation Library](./libraries/regalloc) - A library that allocates registers for a specific backend
- [CodeGen Library](./libraries/codegen) - A library that compiles the IR into code
- [Driver Library](./libraries/driver) - A library that can write code to files and run scripts


## Get Started Now!

Most people usually use Makefiles for this, but I mainly use shell scripts `.sh`. You can find `Run.sh` and `Clean.sh` in the root directory. You can run this whole program with

```console
./Run.sh && ./Clean.sh
```

Keep in mind that `Clean.sh` isn't needed to run this program, but it is recommended because it cleans up the executable that was just ran.
